	Problem #2: Even Fibonacci numbers
	https://projecteuler.net/problem=2
	
	Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by
	adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
	the first 10 terms will be:

		1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

	By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose
	values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
	even-valued terms.

var a = 1,
	b = 2,
	total = 0,
	holder;

while (b < 4000000) {
	holder = b;
	b += a;
	a = holder;
	
	total += (a % 2 == 0)? a : 0;
}

print(total);
