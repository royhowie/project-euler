    Problem #6: Sum square difference
    https://projecteuler.net/problem=6
    
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
    first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
    3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
    first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

var sum1 = (100/6) * (100 + 1) * (2*100 + 1);
    sum2 = Math.pow((100 * (100 + 1)/2),2);

print(sum2 - sum1);
