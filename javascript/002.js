    Problem #2: Even Fibonacci numbers
    https://projecteuler.net/problem=2
    
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by
    adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
    the first 10 terms will be:

        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose
    values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
    even-valued terms.

var a = 1,
    b = 2,
    total = 0,
    holder;

while (b < 4000000) {
    holder = b;
    b += a;
    a = holder;
    
    total += (a % 2 == 0)? a : 0;
}

print(total);
